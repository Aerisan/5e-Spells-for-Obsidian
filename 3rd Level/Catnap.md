> ## Description
> You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range fall unconscious for the spell's duration. The spell ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. If a target remains unconscious for the full duration, that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can't be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest.<br> <b>At Higher Levels</b>: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional willing creature for each slot level above 3rd.

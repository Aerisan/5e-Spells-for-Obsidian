> ## Description
> You seize the air and compel it to create one of the following effects at a point you can see within range:<br> • One Medium or smaller creature that you choose must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 5 feet away from you.<br> • You create a small blast of air capable of moving one object that is neither held nor carried and that weighs no more than 5 pounds. The object is pushed up to 10 feet away from you. It isn't pushed with enough force to cause damage.<br> • You create a harm less sensory effect using air, such as causing leaves to rustle, wind to slam shutters closed, or your clothing to ripple in a breeze.

> ## Description
> You choose nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one of the following ways:<br> • You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.<br> • You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.<br> • You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both . The change lasts for 1 hour.<br> • You cause simple shapes-such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location- to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.<br> If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three non-instantaneous effects created by it active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

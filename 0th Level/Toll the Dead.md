> ## Description
> You point at one creature you can see within range, and the sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it for a moment. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take ld8 necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its hit points, it instead takes 1d12 necrotic damage.<br> The spell's damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (2d8 or 2d12), 11th level (3d8 or 3d12), and 17th level (4d8 or 4d12).

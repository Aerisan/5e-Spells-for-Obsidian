> ## Description
> You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.<br> Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The DM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.<br> A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.<br> The DM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.

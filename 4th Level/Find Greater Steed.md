> ## Description
> You summon a spirit that assumes the form of a loyal, majestic mount. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the spirit takes on a form you choose: a griffon, a pegasus, a peryton , a dire wolf, a rhinoceros, or a saber-toothed tiger. The creature has the statistics provided in the <i>Monster Manual</i> for the chosen form, though it is a celestial, a fey, or a fiend (your choice) instead of its normal creature type. Additionally, if it has an Intelligence score of 5 or lower, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.<br> You control the mount in combat. While the mount is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. While mounted on it, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target the mount.<br> The mount disappears temporarily when it drops to 0 hit points or when you dismiss it as an action. Casting this spell again re-summons the bonded mount, with all its hit points restored and any conditions removed.<br> You can't have more than one mount bonded by this spell or <i>find steed</i> at the same time. As an action, you can release a mount from its bond, causing it to disappear permanently.<br> Whenever the mount disappears, it leaves behind any objects it was wearing or carrying.

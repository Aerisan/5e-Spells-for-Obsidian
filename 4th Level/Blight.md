> ## Description
> Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.<br> If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.<br> If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw, it simply withers and dies.<br> <b>At Higher Levels</b>: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

> ## Description
> This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled actions. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.<br> An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.<br> 1: The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn.<br> 2-6: The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.<br> 7-8: The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.<br> 9-10: The creature can act and move normally. At the end of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.<br> <b>At Higher Levels</b>: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot above 4th.

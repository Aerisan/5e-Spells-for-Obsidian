> ## Description
> Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.<br> A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.<br> If you choose a target that is held shut with <i>arcane lock</i>, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.<br> When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.

> ## Description
> You touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize on poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.<br> For the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage.

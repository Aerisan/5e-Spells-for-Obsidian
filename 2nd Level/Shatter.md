> ## Description
> A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.<br> A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.<br> <b>At Higher Levels</b>: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

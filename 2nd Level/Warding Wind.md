> ## Description
> A strong wind (20 miles per hour) blows around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for the spell's duration.<br> The wind has the following effects:<br> • It deafens you and other creatures in its area.<br> • It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller.<br> • It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.<br> • The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.<br> • The attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if the attacks pass in or out of the wind.

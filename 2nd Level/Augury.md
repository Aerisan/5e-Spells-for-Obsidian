> ## Description
> By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from the following possible omens.<br> • <i>Weal</i>, for good results<br> • <i>Woe</i>, for bad results<br> • <i>Weal and woe</i>, for both good and bad results<br> • <i>Nothing</i>, for results that aren't especially good or bad<br> The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.<br> If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.

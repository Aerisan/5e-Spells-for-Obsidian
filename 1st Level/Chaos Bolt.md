> ## Description
> You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type. 1 Acid. 2 Cold. 3 Fire. 4 Force. 5 Lightning. 6 Poison. 7 Psychic. 8 Thunder.<br> If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.<br> A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.<br> <b>At Higher Levels</b>: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d6 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.

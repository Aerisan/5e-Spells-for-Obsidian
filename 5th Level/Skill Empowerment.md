> ## Description
> Your magic deepens a creature's understanding of its own talent. You touch one willing creature and give it expertise in one skill of your choice. Until the spell ends, the creature doubles its proficiency bonus for ability checks it makes that use the chosen skill.<br> You must choose a skill in which the target is proficient and that isn't already benefiting from an effect, such as Expertise, that doubles its proficiency bonus.

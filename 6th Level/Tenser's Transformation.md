> ## Description
> You endow yourself with endurance and martial prowess fueled by magic. Until the spell ends , you can't cast spells, and you gain the following benefits:<br> • You gain 50 temporary hit points. If any of these remain when the spell ends, they are lost.<br> • You have advantage on attack rolls that you make with simple and martial weapons.<br> • When you hit a target with a weapon attack, that target takes an extra 2d12 force damage.<br> • You have proficiency with all armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons.<br> • You have proficiency in Strength and Constitution saving throws.<br> • You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.<br> Immediately after the spell ends, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion.

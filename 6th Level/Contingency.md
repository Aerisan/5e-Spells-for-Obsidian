> ## Description
> Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell, called the contingent spell, as part of casting <i>contingency</i>, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a <i>contingency</i> cast with <i>water breathing</i> might stipulate that <i>water breathing</i> comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.<br> The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then <i>contingency</i> ends.<br> The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one <i>contingency</i> spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another <i>contingency</i> spell on you ends. Also, <i>contingency</i> ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.

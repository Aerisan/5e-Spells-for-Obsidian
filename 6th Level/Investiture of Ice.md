> ## Description
> Until the spell ends, ice rimes your body, and you gain the following benefits:<br> • You are immune to cold damage and have resistance to fire damage.<br> • You can move across difficult terrain created by ice or snow without spending extra movement.<br> • The ground in a 10-foot radius around you is icy and is difficult terra in for creatures other than you. The radius moves with you.<br> • You can use your action to create a 15-foot cone of freezing wind extending from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much da mage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect has its speed halved until the start of your next turn.

> ## Description
> You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4+1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.<br> This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.
